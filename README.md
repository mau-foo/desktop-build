# PC Desktop Specifications

This documentation describes the parts and cost for my first pc build. The PC will be used for running more resource extensive applications. A few RDBMS to handle complex data manipulation, data modeling and data warehousing. A web server for personal website and projects. Programming for high resource applications. Gaming for titles such as Fallout or GTA series. 

In general the installation of parts into the tower and setup of the OS in the boot drive was straight forward. My motherboard did not support Ryzen 7 3700x out of box so I updated the BIOS using USB BIOS FlashBack. Used the EZ Tuning Wizard within bios to tune for higher CPU performance and lower the CPU temp (lower 40Â°C). Adjusted fan settings for DC and lower RPM. Fans are connected. ARGB fans controlled with software not ARGB controller. Kept pre-installed thermal paste but within the next few months will apply a better thermal paste. I will need to adjust the memory settings within BIOs to hit 3600 MHz.
